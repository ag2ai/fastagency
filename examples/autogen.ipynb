      "    | \n",
      "    | 1) **Vitruvian \n",
      "    | Man**: The Vitruvian Man is a drawing created by Leonardo da Vinci \n",
      "    | around 1490. It is based on the work of the ancient Roman architect \n",
      "    | Vitruvius, who described the ideal human proportions. The drawing \n",
      "    | represents a man in two superimposed positions with his arms and legs \n",
      "    | apart inside both a square and a circle. This artwork symbolizes the \n",
      "    | blending of art and science during the Renaissance, showcasing \n",

      "    | Lisa**: The Mona Lisa, painted by Leonardo da Vinci during the early \n",
      "    | 16th century, is one of the most famous works of art in the world. The\n",
      "    |  painting depicts a woman with an enigmatic expression sitting against\n",
      "    |  a distant landscape. Known for its intricate details and the \n",
      "    | innovative use of sfumato, the Mona Lisa has been the subject of much \n",

      "    | It resides in the Louvre Museum in Paris.\n",
      "    | \n",
      "    | 3) **Medici Family**: The \n",
      "    | Medici family was a powerful and influential dynasty in Florence \n",
      "    | during the Renaissance. They were major patrons of the arts and played\n",
      "    |  a critical role in the development of Renaissance culture. Leonardo \n",
