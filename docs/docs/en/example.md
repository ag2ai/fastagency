## Quick Start

### Project setup

We **strongly recommend** using [**Cookiecutter**](./user-guide/cookiecutter/index.md) for setting up a FastAgency project. It creates the project folder structure, default workflow, automatically installs all the necessary requirements, and creates a [devcontainer](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers){target="_blank"} that can be used with [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/){target="_blank"} for development.

1. Install Cookiecutter with the following command:
    ```console
    pip install cookiecutter
    ```

2. Run the `cookiecutter` command:
    ```console
    cookiecutter https://github.com/airtai/cookiecutter-fastagency.git
    ```

3. Assuming that you used the default values, you should get the following output:
    ```console
    [1/4] project_name (My FastAgency App):
    [2/4] project_slug (my_fastagency_app):
    [3/4] Select app_type
        1 - fastapi+mesop
        2 - mesop
        3 - nats+fastapi+mesop
        Choose from [1/2/3] (1): 1
    [4/4] Select python_version
        1 - 3.12
        2 - 3.11
        3 - 3.10
        Choose from [1/2/3] (1):
    [5/5] Select authentication
        1 - none
        2 - google
        Choose from [1/2] (1):
    ```

4. To run LLM-based applications, you need an API key for the LLM used. The most commonly used LLM is [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models). To use it, create an [OpenAI API Key](https://openai.com/index/openai-api/) and set it as an environment variable in the terminal using the following command:

    ```console
    export OPENAI_API_KEY=openai_api_key_here
    ```

5. Open the generated project in [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/){target="_blank"} with the following command:
    ```console
    code my_fastagency_app
    ```

6. Once the project is opened, you will get the following option to reopen it in a devcontainer:

    <img src="https://fastagency.ai/0.3/user-guide/getting-started/images/reopen-in-container.png" width="600" class="center">

7. After reopening the project in devcontainer, you can verify that the setup is correct by running the provided tests with the following command:

    ```console
    pytest -s
    ```

    You should get the following output if everything is correctly setup.
    ```console

### Workflow Development

#### Define the Workflow

You need to define the workflow that your application will use. This is where you specify how the agents interact and what they do. Here's a simple example of a workflow definition as it is generated by the cookie cutter under `my_fastagency_app/workflow.py`:

```python
import os
from typing import Any

from autogen.agentchat import ConversableAgent
from fastagency import UI
from fastagency.runtimes.autogen import AutoGenWorkflows

llm_config = {
    "config_list": [
        {
            "model": "gpt-4o-mini",
            "api_key": os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY"),
        }
    ],
    "temperature": 0.8,
}

wf = AutoGenWorkflows()


@wf.register(name="simple_learning", description="Student and teacher learning chat")  # type: ignore[misc]
def simple_workflow(ui: UI, params: dict[str, Any]) -> str:
    initial_message = ui.text_input(
        sender="Workflow",
        recipient="User",
        prompt="I can help you learn about mathematics. What subject you would like to explore?",
    )

    student_agent = ConversableAgent(
        name="Student_Agent",
        system_message="You are a student willing to learn.",
        llm_config=llm_config,
    )
    teacher_agent = ConversableAgent(
        name="Teacher_Agent",
        system_message="You are a math teacher.",
        llm_config=llm_config,
    )

    chat_result = student_agent.initiate_chat(
        teacher_agent,
        message=initial_message,
        summary_method="reflection_with_llm",
        max_turns=3,
    )

    return str(chat_result.summary)
```

This code snippet sets up a simple learning chat between a student and a teacher. It defines the agents and how they should interact and specify how the conversation should be summarized.

#### Run and Debug the Workflow

To ensure that the workflow we have defined is working properly, we can test it locally using MesopUI. The code below can be found under `my_fastagency_app/local/main_mesop.py` and imports the defined workflow and sets up MesopUI.

You can run the Mesop application locally with the following command on Linux and MacOS:

```console
gunicorn my_fastagency_app.local.main_mesop:app
```

On Windows, please use the following command:
```console
waitress-serve --listen=0.0.0.0:8000 my_fastagency_app.local.main_mesop:app
```

Open the MesopUI URL [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000) in your browser. You can now use the graphical user interface to start, run, test and debug the autogen workflow manually.
