# Web Scraping and Infobip WhatsApp API Integration

In this tutorial, we will explore how to leverage the **FastAgency** framework to create a dynamic and interactive chatbot that integrates two powerful agents:

1. **WebSurferAgent** – A web-scraping agent capable of retrieving relevant content from webpages.
2. **WhatsAppAgent** – An agent that interacts with the [Infobip WhatsApp API](https://www.infobip.com/docs/api/channels/whatsapp){target="_blank"} to send WhatsApp messages based on the user’s request.

The chat system will operate between these two agents and the user, allowing them to scrape web content and send the relevant information via WhatsApp, all within a seamless conversation. This tutorial will guide you through setting up these agents, handling user interaction, and ensuring secure API communication.

## What You’ll Learn

By the end of this tutorial, you will understand how to:

1. Integrate external APIs like [Infobip WhatsApp API](https://www.infobip.com/docs/api/channels/whatsapp){target="_blank"} with FastAgency.
2. Build and register agents that autonomously scrape the web for relevant information.
3. Use **FastAgency workflows** to manage agent interactions and user input.
4. Present scraped content to the user and offer sending that content via WhatsApp.
5. Handle secure API credentials and ensure safe communication between agents.

We will walk through setting up each agent, handling API security, and creating a cohesive conversation that scrapes data, processes user input, and sends it via WhatsApp in response.

Let’s dive into creating a powerful interactive agent system with **FastAgency**!
