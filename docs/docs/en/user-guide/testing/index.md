# Testing (Coming Soon)

FastAgency is working on introducing a comprehensive testing framework to help developers ensure the reliability and correctness of their multi-agent workflows. This upcoming feature will allow you to write and execute tests for your workflows, ensuring agents behave as expected under various scenarios. The testing tools will seamlessly integrate into your development pipeline, enabling continuous integration (CI) support and ensuring that your applications remain robust and reliable as they scale.

### Key Features (Planned):

- **Automated Workflow Testing**: Define tests to simulate agent interactions and verify correct behavior.

- **CI Integration**: Easily integrate tests into your continuous integration pipelines for automated validation.

- **Mocking External APIs**: Simulate external API responses to test how agents handle external data sources.
