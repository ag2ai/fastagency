# User Interfaces

FastAgency provides multiple ways to interact with and manage your multi-agent workflows through various user interface (UI) options. These interfaces enable developers to interact with agents in different environments—whether it’s a simple text-based console interface for quick testing or a web-based interface for more user-friendly interaction. Each UI option is designed to suit different development needs, from early-stage prototyping to fully deployed web applications.

Below is an overview of the supported UIs, with links to their respective pages for more detailed information.

## Available User Interfaces

### 1. **[ConsoleUI](./console/basics/)**
The **ConsoleUI** provides a command-line interface for interacting with FastAgency's agent workflows. It’s an ideal choice for developers who need to quickly test and prototype workflows directly in the terminal.

### 2. **[MesopUI](./mesop/basics/)**
The **MesopUI** is a web-based interface that enables users to interact with agents through a browser. This UI is designed for applications that need a more graphical and interactive experience for users.

### 3. **[FastAPI UI (Coming Soon)](./fastapi/basics/)**
FastAgency will soon introduce **FastAPI UI** support, which will allow you to build multi-agent systems with a FastAPI backend. This will enable seamless integration with RESTful APIs for modern web applications.
