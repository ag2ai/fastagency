# API Integration

FastAgency makes it easy to integrate external APIs into your multi-agent workflows, allowing agents to access and interact with real-time data. By leveraging FastAgency's API support, developers can automatically create functions properly annotated for use with large language models (LLMs). This functionality allows agents to fetch and process external information seamlessly.

Currently, FastAgency supports importing API functionality from [**OpenAPI**](https://swagger.io/specification/) specifications, enabling developers to connect their agents with RESTful APIs effortlessly. In addition, we support various types of security for accessing APIs, ensuring your integrations are both functional and secure.
