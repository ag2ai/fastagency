# FastAPI + Nats.io

The **FastAPI + Nats.io** Adapter in FastAgency offers the most scalable setup by combining the power of the [**FastAPI**](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/){target="_blank"} framework for building and exposing workflows as [**REST APIs**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/REST){target="_blank"} with the [**Nats.io MQ**](https://nats.io/){target="_blank"} message broker for **scalable and asynchronous** communication. This setup is the **preferred way** for running large workloads in production.

## Use Cases

This section outlines the scenarios where it's particularly beneficial to use the **FastAPI + Nats** Adapter.

### When to Use the FastAPI + Nats.io Adapter

- **High User Demand**: If you need to scale above what can be achieved with multiple-workers of the [**FastAPI** adapter](../fastapi/index.md), then you can use [**Nats.io MQ**](https://nats.io/){target="_blank"}-based message que and multiple workers consuming and producing messages. This kind of distributed, [message-queue architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Message_queue){target="_blank"} allows you to scale up not just across multiple workers, but also across multiple machines and even across multiple clusters.

- **Observability**: If you need the ability to **audit workflow executions** both in realtime and posteriori, the Nats Adapter provides the necessary infrastructure to enable this feature.

- Security features of FastAPI (links etc.)

## Architecture Overview

The following section presents high-level architecture diagrams for the two available setups:

- **FastAPI + Nats Adapter with Mesop Client**
- **FastAPI + Nats Adapter with Custom Client**

=== "FastAPI + Nats Adapter with Mesop Client"

    ![Mesop FastAPI](../images/mesop_fastapi_nats.png)

    The system is composed of three main components:

    #### 1. FastAgency Client App

    The FastAgency Client App serves as the frontend interface for the system. It includes:

    - **Mesop Client**: A friendly web interface for users to interact with the workflows. It facilitates the communication with the user and the FastAPI Provider.
    - **FastAPI Provider**: A component that facilitates communication between the Mesop client and the FastAPI Adapter.

    This app handles all client interactions and presents the results back to the user.

    #### 2. FastAgency FastAPI App

    The FastAgency FastAPI App forms the backend of our system and consists of:

    - **Nats Provider**: Responsible for connecting to the Nats Provider, receiving workflow initiation messages, and distributing them to the workers for execution.
    - **FastAPI Adapter**: This component communicates with AutoGen, and implements routes and websocket for FastAPI.
    - **FastAPI**: Provides the infrastructure for building and exposing AutoGen workflows via REST API.

    #### 3. FastAgency Nats App
    - **Nats Adapter**: This adapter connects to the Nats Provider. Its primary responsibility is to receive workflow initiation messages and delegate them to available workers for execution.
    - **AutoGen Workflows**: These workflows, defined using the AutoGen framework, embody the core logic and behavior of your application. They leverage agents to perform various tasks and accomplish specific goals.

    #### Interaction Flow
    1. The user initiates communication with the Mesop client in the FastAgency Client App.
    2. The Mesop client relays requests, based on user actions, to the FastAPI Provider.
    3. The FastAPI Provider forwards these requests to the FastAPI Adapter in the FastAgency FastAPI App.
    4. The FastAPI Adapter processes the requests and sends a message to the Nats Provider to start the workflow.
    5. The Nats Adapter, connected to the Nats Provider, receives the workflow initiation message.
    6. The Nats Adapter distributes the task of executing the workflow to one of the available workers.
    7. The designated worker executes the AutoGen Workflow and sends the results back through the Nats Provider to the FastAPI Adapter.
    8. The FastAPI Adapter sends the results to the FastAPI Provider, which relays them to the Mesop client for presentation to the client.

    This architecture promotes a clear separation of concerns between the user interface, the API layer, and the workflow execution logic, enhancing modularity and maintainability. The FastAPI framework provides a user-friendly and efficient API, while the Nats Adapter, coupled with the Nats.io MQ message broker, ensures scalability and asynchronous communication.

=== "FastAPI + Nats Adapter with Custom Client"

    ![Mesop FastAPI](../images/custom_fastapi_nats.png)

    The system is composed of three main components:

    #### 1. FastAgency Client App

    The FastAgency Client App serves as the frontend interface for the system. It includes:

    - **Custom Client**: A custom web interface for users to interact with the workflows. It facilitates the communication with the user and the **FastAgency FastAPI App**.

    This custom client app handles all interactions with the **FastAgency FastAPI App** and presents the results back to the user.

    #### 2. FastAgency FastAPI App

    The FastAgency FastAPI App forms the backend of our system and consists of:

    - **Nats Provider**: Responsible for connecting to the Nats Provider, receiving workflow initiation messages, and distributing them to the workers for execution.
    - **FastAPI Adapter**: This component communicates with AutoGen, and implements routes and websocket for FastAPI.
    - **FastAPI**: Provides the infrastructure for building and exposing AutoGen workflows via REST API.

    #### 3. FastAgency Nats App
    - **Nats Adapter**: This adapter connects to the Nats Provider. Its primary responsibility is to receive workflow initiation messages and delegate them to available workers for execution.
    - **AutoGen Workflows**: These workflows, defined using the AutoGen framework, embody the core logic and behavior of your application. They leverage agents to perform various tasks and accomplish specific goals.

    #### Building Custom Client Applications

    For details on building a custom client that interacts with the FastAgency FastAPI backend, check out the guide [here](../fastapi/index.md#building-custom-client-applications). It covers the **routes, message types, and integration steps in detail**, helping you set up seamless communication with FastAgencyâ€™s FastAPI backend.

Now, it's time to see the **FastAPI + Nats Adapter** using FastAgency in action. Let's dive into an example and learn how to use it!

## Installation

Before getting started, make sure you have installed FastAgency by running the following command:

=== "FastAPI + Nats Adapter with Mesop Client"

    ```bash
    pip install "fastagency[autogen,mesop,fastapi,server,nats]"
    ```

    This command installs FastAgency with support for both the Console and Mesop interfaces for AutoGen workflows, but with FastAPI serving input requests and independent workers communicating over Nats.io protocol running workflows.

=== "FastAPI + Nats Adapter with Custom Client"

    ```bash
    pip install "fastagency[autogen,fastapi,server,nats]"
    ```

    This command installs FastAgency, but with FastAPI serving input requests and independent workers communicating over Nats.io protocol running workflows.

## Example: Student and Teacher Learning Chat

=== "FastAPI + Nats Adapter with Mesop Client"

    In this example, we'll create a simple learning chat where a student agent asks questions and a teacher agent responds, simulating a learning environment. We'll use **MesopUI** for the web interface and the **FastAPI + Nats** Adapter to expose the workflow as a REST API.

    ### Step-by-Step Breakdown

    As shown in the [architecture overview](#architecture-overview), this setup requires **three** components (applications). Let's begin with the first component, the [FastAgency NATS App](#3-fastagency-nats-app).

=== "FastAPI + Nats Adapter with Custom Client"

    In this example, we'll create a simple learning chat where a student agent asks questions and a teacher agent responds, simulating a learning environment. We'll use **custom client** for the web interface and the **FastAPI + Nats** Adapter to expose the workflow as a REST API.

    ### Step-by-Step Breakdown

    As shown in the [architecture overview](#architecture-overview), this setup requires **three** components (applications). Let's begin with the first component, the [FastAgency NATS App](#3-fastagency-nats-app_1).

#### 1. **Import Required Modules**

To get started, import the required modules from the **FastAgency** and **AutoGen**. These imports provide the essential building blocks for creating agents, workflows, and integrating with the client. Additionally, import the [**`NatsAdapter`**](../../../api/fastagency/adapters/nats/NatsAdapter.md) class for workflow execution.

```python hl_lines="8"
{!> docs_src/getting_started/nats_n_fastapi/main_1_nats.py [ln:1-9] !}
```

#### 2. **Define Workflow**

Next, define the workflow that your application will use. This is where you specify how the agents interact and what they do. Here's a simple example of a workflow definition:

```python
{! docs_src/getting_started/nats_n_fastapi/main_1_nats.py [ln:11-52] !}
```

#### 3. **Configure the Nats Adapter**

Create an instance of the NatsAdapter and pass your workflow to it. The adapter will handle the communication with the Nats Provider and distribute workflow execution to the workers.

```python hl_lines="5 7"
{!> docs_src/getting_started/nats_n_fastapi/main_1_nats.py [ln:55-60] !}
```

#### 4. **Define FastAgency Application**

Create an NatsAdapter and then add it to a FastAPI application using the lifespan parameter. The adapter will have all REST and Websocket routes for communicating with a client. For more information on the lifespan parameter, check out the official documentation [**here**](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/advanced/events/){target="_blank"}

```python
{!> docs_src/getting_started/nats_n_fastapi/main_1_nats.py [ln:61] !}
```

#### 5. **Adapter Chaining**

Above, we created Nats.io provider that will start brokers waiting to consume initiate workflow messages from the message broker.

=== "FastAPI + Nats Adapter with Mesop Client"

    Next, we set up a FastAPI service to interact with the NATS.io provider. This introduces the second component: the [**FastAgency FastAPI App**](#2-fastagency-fastapi-app).

    !!! note "main_2_fastapi.py"
        ```python hl_lines="16-18 21-22"
        {!> docs_src/getting_started/nats_n_fastapi/main_2_fastapi.py [ln:1-22] !}
        ```

    Finally, the third component is the [**FastAgency Client App**](#1-fastagency-client-app), which uses the **Mesop client** to communicate with both the user and the FastAPI provider.

    !!! note "main_3_mesop.py"
        ```python hl_lines="7-9 11"
        {!> docs_src/getting_started/nats_n_fastapi/main_3_mesop.py [ln:1-11] !}
        ```

=== "FastAPI + Nats Adapter with Custom Client"

    Next, weâ€™ll set up a FastAPI service to interact with the NATS.io provider, introducing the second component: the [**FastAgency FastAPI App**](#2-fastagency-fastapi-app_1).


    !!! note "main_fastapi_custom_client.py"
        ```python hl_lines="17-19 22-23"
        {!> docs_src/getting_started/nats_n_fastapi/main_2_fastapi_custom_client.py [ln:1-8,96-110] !}
        ```

    Finally, for simplicity, we will serve our custom HTML client as part of the same [**FastAgency FastAPI App**](#2-fastagency-fastapi-app_1) using FastAPI's [**HTMLResponse**](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/advanced/custom-response/#html-response){target="_blank"}.

    !!! note

        - The below example uses a **simple HTML with JavaScript**, all in a single string and served directly from the FastAgency FastAPI app for **simplicity**.
        - This approach is **not suitable for production** but ideal for demonstrating core concepts.
        - In a real-world scenario, you'd use a separate frontend, built with frameworks like React or Vue.js, or other languages such as Java, Go, or Ruby, based on your project needs.

    !!! note "main_fastapi_custom_client.py"
        ```python
        {!> docs_src/getting_started/nats_n_fastapi/main_2_fastapi_custom_client.py [ln:9-95,113-115] !}
        ```


#### 6. **Nats server setup**

The `NatsAdapter` requires a running Nats server. The easiest way to start the Nats server is by using [Docker](https://www.docker.com/){target="_blank"}. FastAgency uses the [JetStream](https://docs.nats.io/nats-concepts/jetstream){target="_blank"} feature of Nats and also utilizes authentication.

```python hl_lines="1 3 6 11 17"
{!> docs_src/getting_started/nats_n_fastapi/nats-server.conf [ln:1-23]!}
```

In the above Nats configuration, we define a user called `fastagency`, and its password is read from the environment variable `FASTAGENCY_NATS_PASSWORD`. We also enable JetStream in Nats and configure Nats to serve via the appropriate ports.
